# Biclustering-of-Expression-Data-using-Evolutionary-Computing

### It is the implementation of [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1613863/)

#### <p align="justify"> The approach is based on evolutionary algorithms, which have been proven to have excellent performance on complex problems, and searches for biclusters following a sequential covering strategy. The goal is to find biclusters of maximum size with mean squared residue lower than a given threshold over gene-expression data. In addition, more attention is paid to the fact of looking for high-quality biclusters with large variation, i.e., with a relatively high row variance, and with a low level of overlapping among biclusters.</p>
